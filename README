About

This is a RESTful web service using Jersey (http://jersey.java.net/), that calculates the area of a square, rectangle or triangle. The result is returned in JSON notation.

Requirements

This assumes you have the following already installed:
Java
Maven
Tomcat

Usage
-----
In the calculate-ws directory run the"mvn package" command.  You will see a lot of output at the end of which you should see a "Build Succesful" message.

A "calculate.war" file will be created in the calculate-ws/target directory.  Deploy that calculate.war file to tomcat's webapp directory.
